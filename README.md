# A-Website
First collaboration in GitHub...yea baby!
hoping to make a website that can make money somehow
it might be a wine website for my uncle in law;
it might be a waffle-based theme;
can I put a link in here?:  this would be the link to model for wine site:  http://alorigine.eu/index.php?page=Qui-Sommes-Nous&PHPSESSID=d7421238ccf71b434709bca999be5846 
currently waiting on proposal approval for wine site.
IDEAS needed if not wine page...
